![Typography, this image was rendered with this library, in subpixel rendering mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7447159/31848163-cc9e00fe-b655-11e7-8a40-69258e440c7a.png)
===========

Pure C# Font Reader, Glyph Layout and Rendering.
---

Forked from https://github.com/LayoutFarm/Typography and modified to make the library portions available as nuget packages.

While developing the [PixelFarm Rendering library](https://github.com/PaintLab/PixelFarm),

I figured that the way to render a glyph from a font may be useful for other libraries.

So, I spinned off the way to render a glyph from a font to here, the **Typography** library.

Cross Platform
---

The Typography library is **a cross-platform library** and does **NOT** need the PixelFarm Rendering library.

You can use the library to read font files (.ttf, .otf, .ttc, .otc, .woff, .woff2) and

1) Access [all information inside the font](Typography.OpenFont/Typeface.cs). 
2) Layout the font glyphs according to the [OpenFont specification](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=66391).

_The core modules (Typography.OpenFont, Typography.GlyphLayout) do **NOT** provide a glyph rendering implementation_. 
But as you are able to access and read all glyphs, it is easy to render them provided the exact position of each glyph.

Below are some screenshots of projects that use Typography to read each glyph
from font files and render using their rendering engine.

Project arrangement: The purpose of each project
---

The core modules are Typography.OpenFont and Typography.GlyphLayout.
 
**Typography.OpenFont**

- This project is the core and does not depend on other projects.
- This project contains [a font reader](Typography.OpenFont/OpenFontReader.cs) that can read files implementing Open Font Format
  ([ISO/IEC 14496-22:2015](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=66391) and [Microsoft OpenType Specification](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Typography/OpenTypeSpecification.aspx))
  or Web Open Font Format (either WOFF [1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-WOFF-20121213/) or [2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/))
- The OpenType GSUB, GPOS layout mechanism is in here but a more easy-to-use interface is provided in **Typography.GlyphLayout** below.
- No Visual/Graphics Rendering Here


**Typography.GlyphLayout**

_Since the GlyphLayout engine is not stable and quite complex, 
I separated this from the OpenFont core project._

- This project invokes OpenType Layout Engine/Mechanism (esp. GSUB, GPOS) inside Typography.OpenFont
- The engine converts a string to a list of glyph indexes, then substitutes glyphs
   and places them into proper positions with respect to the provided settings,
      eg [Script/Languague Setup](https://github.com/LayoutFarm/Typography/issues/82), 
           or [Advanced GSUB/GPOS on Emoji](https://github.com/LayoutFarm/Typography/issues/18)
- No Visual/Graphics Rendering Here

_1) CoreModules, 2) Typography.One: a more easy-to-use than core module_

PixelFarm's Typography
---

Since the core library does not provide a glyph rendering implementation, You can learn
how to do it from the example repositories above, or you may learn it from my 
implementation => [**PixelFarm.Typography**](PixelFarm.Typography).

PixelFarm.Typography links the core Typography library to the _PixelFarm_ Rendering library.
You can learn how to implement string drawing, how to implement text-layout services, and how to cache glyph shapes, so you can apply this to your own library.
